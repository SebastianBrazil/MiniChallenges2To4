MiniChallenge Two To Four - Endpoints

This project has three API controllers, one for each challenge 2-4. The first takes any two numbers and adds them, the second takes a name and a time to output a sentence, and the third compares two numbers to see which is greater.

1/9/24: Created and built out the whole project, tackling the three API controllers one by one.

Peer review: Avery Hillstrom- Very solid code with good data validation! Did not run into any errors running it in swagger or postman, and the endpoints requiring numerical endpoints return a message telling the user to enter numbers if a string is entered. The output messages were amusing, overall very good code!
